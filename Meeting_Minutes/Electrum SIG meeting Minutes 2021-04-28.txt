Electrum SIG meeting Minutes 2021-04-28
======================================

1.  Status of kralverdes current work \u2013 assets on server / client
2.  Discussion: Create a new official release "as is" to support 3rd parties
3.  How to get more people involved? Requirements?

==========

-The ElectrumX server has made good progress

-Currently, for RVN (like for bitcoin), the server pushes changes to the client after the client registers
-For assets, every 10 blocks the client sends requests to the server asking for client changes

-Currently working on a client side asset database to speed up inquiries
-There will eventually also be a server-side asset database
	-right now electrumx is doing the RPC inquiries, but eventually should track its own

-Currently working on getting assets viewable in the GUI. Next will work on server for creating and transferring assets.

-Plan to move the latest version of the client to the SIG repo

-Jeroz has agreed to build the MacOS version

-There is currently a problem which sometimes causes DDOS failure. The client locks up because the server refuses to answer the client
-This can be resolved by changing a parameter:

	-default is 1Mbytes. It should be increased to 10MBytes
