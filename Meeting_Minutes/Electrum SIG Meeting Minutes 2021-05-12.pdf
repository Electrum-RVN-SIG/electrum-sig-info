(Electrum SIG Meeting Minutes 2021-05-12)'
(========================================)'
()'
(1.  Current status -- electrum sever and client, problem on testnet with some blocks)'
(2.  Discussion: remaining work needed for a first release)'
(3.  Test requirements -- what to test and how)'
()'
(====)'
()'
(-The electrum client now has a server-side asset database in addition to the transaction database)'
()'
(-Currently, the client gui supports displaying assets but not acting on them)'
()'
(-Most work this week has been on the electrumx server)'
(        -the server is reverse compatible: the asset-aware server works with the asset-aware client, but also with t)'
(he old non-asset client)'
(        -the server/client protocol has been extended with new asset commands. This still needs to be documented)'
(        -the client can ask the server \(pull\) for asset data; it can also subscribe to data for an asset so that it )'
(gets pushed)'
()'
(-The new server implementation has had to be patched to prevent hang due to some malformed coinbase mining transacti)'
(ons on testnet)'
(        -eg: txid=f90dccc9d1b40230b4b6eddcdc543f0cad4a3771e51a7a57dccced959adc563a)'
(        -rawtransaction: 020000000001010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff)'
(                        2b03a0d30204345a4b5e686f6e676b6f6e672f7777772e6f6b65782e636f6d2f010000000000000000000000ffff)'

(        -these transactions burn the coinbase mining reward by failing to provide a destination address)'
()'
(-There was some question of Electrum BIP39 and BIP44 support. Electrum supports BIP39. But it uses a custom seed phr)'
(ase algo \(not BIP44\). )'
(        -That has always been the case with Electrum)'
(        -This may be changed later to support BIP44)'
()'
(-There is support for the servers to do peering without the need for a peer list. This needs to be tested.)'
()'
(-There is currently some concern that there may be memory leaks in the asset support code)'
(        -This needs additional testing, but so far no leaks have been found)'
()'
(-Hardware wallet support)'
(        -Trezor and Ledger continue to function for RVN. Can send and receive)'
(        -Asset support still needs work)'

(        -Plan to remove support for all other brands of hw wallets)'
()'
(-The Electrumx server needs asset index and transaction index)'
(        -server syncing takes about 5 hours with 1 core & 4GB; has 3GB database)'
(        -currently, it cannot see details of transactions before 11-5-2018 when assets went live; will fix this late)'
(r)'
()'
(-Currently, there are only 3 Electrumx servers live)'
(        -we need about another week of testing and patching)'
(        -after that, we should request the Foundation to help by hosting two servers)'
()'
(-Current repository locations:)'
(        -the Electrumx serves code is on the Electrum-RVN-SIG repository)'
(        -the electrum client is on the kralverde repo. It will be moved to the SIG repo when it is ready)'
()'
(-The sync'ing mechanism of the electrum client has been dramatically changed)'
(        -originally the client used a file with checkpoints in which there was a checkpoint for every 2016 blocks wi)'
(th the same difficulty on bitcoin)'
(        -each checkpoing contained the hash of the last header in that 2016 block chunk plus the difficulty of that )'
(chunk)'
(        -previously the client retrieved the headers only after the last checkpoint)'
()'
(        -but with Ravencoin Digital Gravity Wave, the difficulty changes with each block)'
(        -so now there is an 80MB file of headers and difficulty for every block)'
(        -now the clients all sync all headers beginning with genesis, requesting a max of 2016 headers at a time fro)'
(m the server)'
(        -the result is a 210.1MB header database stored by the client. It is 15MB size=ion-disk because it is a spar)'
