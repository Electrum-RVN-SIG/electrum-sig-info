Electrum SIG Meeting Minutes 2021-03-24
=======================================

There was discussion of the priority ranking of things to do
	1st priority is to create documentation of the current status with instructions for setting up the client and server
	2nd priority is to support assets
	3rd is to address any remaining ledger and trezor problems

There was discussion of the currently known remaining ledger and trezor problems
	Those may be unsolvable (transactions with a large # of inputs or which spend from a transaction with a large # of outputs)
	For debugging purposes, download the code from Tezor's github. It has a very nice emulator which shows the messages being passed

There was discussion of the ledger-electrum channel
	Since the same work is ongoing in electrum-sig-working, leger-electrum channel should be locked
	But we should generate the status/instructions document and post it there as a final message before locking the channel 

It was pointed out that ravencoin.org/ledger and support.ledger.com both need updating because the information there is no longer correct.

itsSticky volunteered to help with the status/instructions documentation

Additional discussion about the large-transaction problems of Ledger and Trezor
	Similar problems have been reported on other coins/wallets. These problems are not Ravencoin-specific.
	It would be good to understand them in detail eventually
	The most practical solution at present is to create a progress spinner to at least inform the user that the wallet has not frozen

We discussed the need for "trusted" Electrum servers hosted and maintained by the Foundation
	This can be helpful if not enough vounteers run servers
	It is needed if the community does a Bluewallet mobile wallet

There was discussion of starting to understand the Electrum code better by generating documentation of each py file in the source
	kraverde will set up Sphinx on github with user guide for how 

There was discussion of where general SIG information should be stored such as the list of Electrum SIG members
	The SIG github account should contain one repository where various documents and binaries can be stored
	That repository should have "Gitpages" enabled so that the information can be accessed by a browser at github.io
