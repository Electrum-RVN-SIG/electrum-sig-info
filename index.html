    Electrum client testing help needed!<br>
    <br>
    Hello everyone,<br>
    We need your help to test out electrum ravencoin 0.3.0! This release
    will allow you to view assets, but NOT send or create them.<br>
    <br>
    Github: <a
      href="https://github.com/kralverde/electrum-ravencoin-utd">https://github.com/kralverde/electrum-ravencoin-utd</a><br>
    Binaries: <a
href="https://github.com/kralverde/electrum-ravencoin-utd/releases/tag/v0.3.2">https://github.com/kralverde/electrum-ravencoin-utd/releases/tag/v0.3.2</a><br>
    <br>
    Run the wallet on test net by starting the binary from the command
    line while adding the option --testnet<br>
    (For example,<br>
    on OSX: <br>
    /Applications/Electrum-Ravencoin.app/Contents/MacOS/run_electrum
    --testnet<br>
    <br>
    on Windows portable:<br>
    C:\Users\user\Downloads\electrum-ravencoin-0.3.0-portable.exe
    --testnet<br>
    )<br>
    <br>
    When testing we would like you to try out all aspects of the client,
    but place some emphasis on:<br>
    * Receiving assets (transferred from asset-supported wallets, or
    importing watch-only addresses)<br>
    * Sending normal ravencoin from addresses that also contain assets<br>
    * Building binaries from scratch<br>
    * Hardware support (Ledger or Trezor)<br>
    <br>
    When finding an error please make an issue on the github page or
    send a message in #electrum-sig-working including a brief
    description of the problem, screenshots or log files if applicable,
    and what version you were using (e.g. pure python, windows portable
    exe, etc.)<br>
    <br>
    Please note that the electrum client is light weight and for "normal
    usage". If you import an address with lots of transactions (e.g.
    burn addresses or mining pools) the servers will drop your sync
    request.<br>
    <br>
    If you choose to import youR wallet file, make sure to back it up
    before hand.<br>
    <br>
    If you would like some testnet rvn, ping me for some.<br>
    <br>
    If you decide to use this release for mainnet transactions, please
    understand we are still testing this version. If you really must,
    send a small amount beforehand.<br>

    <hr width="100%" size="2">The Ravencoin Electrum Special Interest
    Group currently develops, maintains, and supports:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The Ravencoin version of the Electrum client/wallet</li>
      <li>Legder and Trezor hardware wallet support by that client</li>
      <li>The Ravencoin version of the Electrumx server</li>
    </ol>
    Please note that these are <i><b>WORKS IN PROGRESS</b></i>. <br>
    You are welcome to use any software or other information posted
    here, but you do so <i><b>AT YOUR OWN RISK</b></i>.<br>
    <br>
    The current versions of the software supports the two hardware
    wallets. <br>
    The current versions of the Electrum software (both with and without
    a hardware wallet) support RVN coins as well as viewsing Ravencoin
    assets. Support for creating or transferring Ravencoin assets is
    undergoing development, but is not yet available. <br>
    <br>
    Most comunications within the Ravencoin Electrum SIG takes place on
    the Ravencoin Discord server.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time work takes place in the <u>#electrum-sig-working</u>
        text channel. Anyone can participate,</li>
      <li>Meetings take place in the <u>#electrum-sig-meetings</u>
        voice channel on Wednesdays at 20:30 UTC. Anyone can listen to

    <hr width="100%" size="2"><u>Documentation Project</u><br>
    <br>
    The Electrum SIG is still interested in volunteers for improving the
    original source code documentation:<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>1) Work has started on documenting each of the py source
      code files of the Electrum client and Electrumx server so that we
      can better define the changes which need to be made. Please see:<br>
      <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fhDwO2n5d6sukPEhu3igELMFKHDABimRi4pvyNgm4c/mobilebasic">&nbsp;https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fhDwO2n5d6sukPEhu3igELMFKHDABimRi4pvyNgm4c/mobilebasic</a><br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <blockquote>2) We need another team to work in parallel to define
      what asset support in the Raven-Electrum client GUI should look
      like and which user asset functionality should be implemented in
      the client. So if you are able to donate some of your time and
      expertise, please join the conversation in the
      electrum-sig-working channel to self-organize a team and create a
      spec which describes those topics.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <blockquote>3) We know that the Bitcoin-Cash community created an
      asset-aware version of Electrum called Elecron Cash SLP to support
      their SLP colored-coin assets. We need one or more people to
      prepare and publish a report detailing what (if any) ideas and/or
      code we can take from Electron Cash SLP to benefit our project of
      supporting Ravencoin assets in Electrum. If you are familiar with
      Electron Cash SLP or are willing to study it, please discuss in
      the working channel.<br>
